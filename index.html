      <p>The Lone Starfish is often found on the ocean floor, slowly crawling its way across the sand in search of food. Starfish are not actually fish; they are echinoderms, closely related to sea urchins and sand dollars. These fascinating creatures have no brain and no blood, yet they are capable of amazing regeneration.</p>

      <p>Starfish, also known as sea stars, are marine animals that are star-shaped and come in a variety of colors and sizes. Despite their name, they are not actually fish. Starfish have five arms and can regenerate lost ones. They feed mostly on shellfish. The Lone Starfish in our story was discovered on a quiet beach, surrounded by clear water and white sand.</p>
